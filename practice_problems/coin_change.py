""" Coin Change

This problem comes from a video in the interviewing.io youtube channel.

The problem is described as:
    You are a cash register software and given an amount of change to 
    return, determine how many of each coin you have to give back.

"""

# Lets say that I have to return 33 cents.

def return_change(amount_to_return):
    pass
