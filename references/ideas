1. what happens when I make functions have their own port. right now we make all transmissions via a single port. Use low
level  network programming to try to implement that.

* need client and server
* need to be able to give the the consumers a list of available functions and their ports

* server starts up
* client starts up
* client searches for server
* connects to server
* maps functions
* start testing
